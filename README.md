# [Instant Webpack 2][published url]
## Instructor: [Dan Wellman][instructor url]


Webpack is a module bundler for front-end web appsâ€”it bundles all of your script and asset files together and makes them ready for testing and distribution. The much-anticipated version 2 of Webpack is now available, so this is a great time to get started with Webpack or to update your knowledge!

In this course you'll learn all about the JavaScript module loader and bundler Webpack. You'll take a sample front-end web project and create a build system for it using Webpack. Along the way, you'll see how to configure development and production builds, how to use plugins to transform our source code into bundles, and how to handle common tasks like minification, caching, and code-splitting. You'll even get to take a look at some new features of Webpack, such as tree-shaking and hot module replacement.
